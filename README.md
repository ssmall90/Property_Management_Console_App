# üè† Property Management App

## üìù Overview
The Property Management App is a project developed as part of a university assignment. It serves as a tool for property management agencies to create and manage property portfolios efficiently. Users can perform various tasks such as adding new properties, defining property types (renovations or new builds), managing expenses, and tracking profits for each property in their portfolio.

## ‚ú® Features
1. **Property Management**: Users can create and manage property portfolios.
2. **Property Types**: Properties can be categorized as renovations or new builds.
3. **Expense Tracking**: Expenses for each property can be recorded and managed.
4. **Profit Calculation**: Users can declare the sale value of properties and track profits.
5. **CSV Upload**: Portfolio data can be uploaded using CSV files, allowing for easy data management.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Language**: C#
- **UI**: Console Application
- **Data Management**: CSV Files

## üöÄ Usage
- Clone the repository.
- Open the solution in Visual Studio.
- Compile and run the application.
- Follow the prompts to add properties, manage expenses, and track profits.

## üéì Credits
- Developed as part of a university project to test my ability creating an object orientated application. 


## Encapsulation 
Encapsulation was used throughout the project to ensure the integrity of class members. This is most evident in the 'Project' Class seen below.

```cs
    public class Project
    {

        private string _type; // project type . land or renovation ? 
        private float _cost;
        private List<float> _purchases; // list of all purchases from a project
        private float _totalPurchases; // total cost of all purchases from a project
        private List<float> _sales; // list of all sales from a project
        private float _totalSales; // total cost of all sales from a project
        private float _refunds; // all refunds from a project
        private float _profits; // all profits from a project



        public int ID { get; private set; } // ID for project

        static int NextID = 201; // Starting ID

        public List<float> Purchases 

        {
            get { return _purchases; }
            private set { _purchases = value; } // cannont fully protect list contents? 

        }


        public List<float> Sales 
        {
            get { return _sales; }
            private set { _sales = value; } // cannont fully protect list contents? 
        }

        public float TotalPurchases // Protected total value of all purchases of a project
        {
            get { return _totalPurchases; }
            protected set { _totalPurchases = value; }

        }

        public float TotalSales // Protected total value of all sales of a project
        {
            get { return _totalSales; }
            protected set { _totalSales = value; }

        }

        public float Profits // Protected value of preofits from a project 
        {
            get { return _profits; }
            protected set { _profits = value; }
        }

        public float Refunds // Protected value of refunds from a project
        {
            get { return _refunds; }
            protected set { _refunds = value; }

        }

        protected string Type // Tyep cannot be altered once object instantiated
        {
            get { return _type; }
            set // Conditions set for project type. 
            {
                if (value.ToUpper() == "L" || value.ToUpper() == "R")
                {
                    _type = value;
                }
                else
                {
                    throw new Exception("Project Type Must Be Either 'L' OR 'R'.");
                }
            }
        }


        public Project(float pInitialPurchase, string TypeOfProject) : this (pInitialPurchase,TypeOfProject,NextID)
        {
            ID = NextID;
            NextID++;
 
        }

        public Project(float pInitialPurchase, string TypeOfProject, int IDNum)
        {
            ID = IDNum;
            _purchases = new List<float>();
            _sales = new List<float>();
            _cost = pInitialPurchase;
            _purchases.Add(pInitialPurchase);
            _totalPurchases = pInitialPurchase;
            Type = TypeOfProject;
            _type = Type;
            _profits = _totalSales - _totalPurchases;
            _refunds = CalculateTaxRefund(this);
        }
```
All the class members are set to private. Properties have been created to ensure conditions are met before the value of a 
member variable is altered. Access to properties have been set to protected, allowing them to be accessed by class methods
but not by any other part of the program. 


## Inheritence 
Inheritance was used throughout the project. This is most evident in the 'Menu Item' Class seen below. 

```cs

    
        public class TypeOfEditToProject : MenuItem 
    {
        private List<TypeOfEditToProject> _menu;
        private Project _project;
        private ProjectManager _manager;
        public override void Select()
        {
            Console.Clear();
            Console.WriteLine("Which Of The Following Would You Like To Do? Enter A Corresponding Number");
            _menu.Add(new AddPurchase(_manager, _project));
            _menu.Add(new RemovePurchase(_manager, _project));
            _menu.Add(new AddSale(_manager, _project));
            _menu.Add(new RemoveSale(_manager, _project));

            Console.WriteLine(MenuExtras.PrintMenu(_menu));

            switch (MenuExtras.GetItemInRange(1, _menu.Count +1))
            {
                case 1:
                    _menu[0].Select();

                    break;
                case 2:
                    _menu[1].Select();
                    break;
                case 3:
                    _menu[2].Select();
                    break;
                case 4:
                    _menu[3].Select();
                    break;
                case 5:
                    MenuExtras.ReturnToMainMenu("");
                    break;
            }
        }

        public TypeOfEditToProject(ProjectManager manager, Project project)
        {
            _menu = new List<TypeOfEditToProject>();
            _manager = manager;
            _project = project;
        }
    }
    
        public class AddPurchase : TypeOfEditToProject 
    {
        private ProjectManager _manager;
        private Project _project;

        public override void Select()
        {
            _project.AddPurchase();
            MenuExtras.ReturnToMainMenu("Your Purchase Has Been Added To Your Chosen Project");

        }

        public override string ToString()
        {
            return "Add Purchase";
        }

        public AddPurchase(ProjectManager manager, Project project) : base(manager, project)
        {
            _manager = manager;
            _project = project;
        }
    }
```
In the code above. The 'TypeOfEditToProject' is a child class of the 'Menu Item' class and the 'Add Purchase' class is derived from the 'TypeOfEditToProject' class. 

## Abstraction 
The project has one abstract class implemented. This is the 'Menu Item' class and can be seen in the code snippet below. 

```cs
    public abstract class MenuItem
    {
        public abstract void Select();

        public MenuItem ()
        {

        }

    }
```

## Polymorphism 
The Abstract method 'Select' in the 'Menu Item' class above is overridden throuhout the code. An example of this can be seen below. 

```cs
    public class EditExsistingProject : MenuItem
    {
        private ProjectManager _manager;
        private List<MenuItem> _menus;
        public override void Select()
        {
            Console.Clear();
            Console.WriteLine("Which Project Would You Like To Edit?\r\n");


            for (int i = 0; i < _manager._projects.Count; i++)  //Print List of Projects
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"{i + 1}: {_manager._projects[i].ToString()}");

                Console.WriteLine("------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------");
            }

            Console.WriteLine($"{_manager._projects.Count + 1}. Exit"); // Print Exit Option

            int selectedOption = MenuExtras.GetItemInRange(1, _manager._projects.Count + 1); // Get users selected project

            if ( selectedOption <= _manager._projects.Count)
            {
                Project selectedProject = _manager._projects[selectedOption - 1]; 

                _menus.Add(new TypeOfEditToProject(_manager, selectedProject)); // Pass selected project to new type of edit menu item

                _menus[0].Select();
            }

            else
            {
                MenuExtras.ReturnToMainMenu("");
            }

        }

        public override string ToString()
        {
            return "Edit Existing Project";
        }

        public EditExsistingProject(ProjectManager manager)
        {
            _manager = manager;
            _menus = new List<MenuItem>();
        }
    }
```

## Source Control
During the project source control was used. Updates to the project were commited to github at multiple checkpoints. The code for the project has 
comments throughout. Unfortunatley I did not realise that source control was an element we was being marked on untill the majority of the project 
was completed. Due to this , I have not clearly logged my the specific updates that was actually made along the process. 

## User Interaction

An example of consideration for user interaction can be seen in the code snippet below. 
```cs
    public class RemoveExsisitingProject : MenuItem 
    {
        private ProjectManager _manager;
        private List<MenuItem> _menus;
        public override void Select() // Remove Project
        {
            Console.Clear();
            
            Console.WriteLine("Which Project Would You Like To Remove\r\n");

            for (int i = 0; i < _manager._projects.Count; i++)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"{i + 1} {_manager._projects[i]}");
                Console.WriteLine("------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------");
            }

            Console.WriteLine($"{ _manager._projects.Count + 1}. Exit"); // Exit Option Incoorporated 

            int selectedProject = MenuExtras.GetItemInRange(1, _manager._projects.Count + 1);

            if ( selectedProject <=  _manager._projects.Count ) 
            {
                _manager._projects.RemoveAt(selectedProject - 1);
                MenuExtras.ReturnToMainMenu("The Selected Project Was Removed From Your Portfolio");
            }

            else
            {
                MenuExtras.ReturnToMainMenu("");
            }

```

Initially the method in this code would not offer the user an option to exit the screen. This meant that once comminted to this method a project 
had to be deleted in order to continue. I incoorporated an exit option to the bottom of the options on the menu. 

## File Loading

The code below shows 1 example of how attempts were made to ensure robustness of the file loading process of the application. 

```cs
         public void UploadFile() // Upload A File
        {
            bool isValid = false;
            do
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Please Enter Enter The Name Of The .txt or .tml File You Want To Upload To The System");
                string userInput = Console.ReadLine();
                Console.WriteLine("");
                try // Check File Has '.' Extension
                {
                    string testData = userInput.Split('.')[1];

                }
                catch
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("File Not Valid. \r\n\r\nPlease Ensure You Enter The Full File Name E.g. 'file.txt', 'file.tml'");
                    Console.WriteLine();
                    continue;
                }
                switch (userInput.Split('.')[1]) // Confirm If File Is TXT or TML
                {
                    case "txt":
                        GetCSVFile(userInput);
                        isValid = true;
                        break;
                    case "tml":
                        GetTMLFile(userInput);
                        isValid = true;
                        break;
                    default:
                        Console.WriteLine("File Type Invalid");
                        Console.WriteLine() ;
                        break;
                }
            }
            while (!isValid);
        }
```
The code above shows the intial check on the file inputted. This check ensures that the file name entered by the user has the correct file extension.
